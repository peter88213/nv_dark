# User guide

This page refers to the latest 
[nv_dark](https://github.com/peter88213/nv_dark/) release.
You can open it with **Help > nv_dark Online help**.

The plugin adds a **nv_dark Online Help** entry to the **Help** menu. 

The dark mode is active at program startup. 
However, the very first time you run *novelibre* in dark mode, 
you might be asked for a program restart to set the 
*novelibre*-specific colors.

## Restoring the original colors

After uninstalling the *nv_dark* plugin via the plugin manager, close *novelibre*.
Then open the installation directory and run `restore_default_colors.py`.
